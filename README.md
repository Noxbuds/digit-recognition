# digit-recognition
Predicting handwritten digits from the MNIST data set using a convolutional neural network. 98.36% accuracy with weights in network.pth

After following this tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html, I decided to try create a network to recognise
hand-written digits by training it on the MNIST dat set. I used and adapted some of the code in this tutorial for training and testing.
